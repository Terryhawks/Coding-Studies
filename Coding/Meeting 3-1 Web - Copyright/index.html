  <h2>What is Copyright</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Copyright : (Noun) The exclusive legal right, given to an originator or an assignee to print, publish, perform, film, or record literary, artistic, or musical material, and to authorize others to do the same.</li>
    <li>Copyright : (Adjective) To be protected by Copyright</li>
    <li>Copyright : (Verb) To secure Copyright for Something, Commonly Music, Videos, Designs, Published Books, and others.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h2>Why Did Copyright even Exist?</h2>
  <p>Imagine you worked hard to make a great thing, then, someone else just claimed it as theirs. That is what happens without Copyright. With Copyright, you can prevent others from claiming it as theirs. Of course, people can, still make it, but if they were found making it without permission, they would be in a lot of Legal Trouble, with threat of being sent to jail.</p>
  <p>This, is meant to promote the progress of science and art by protecting the exclusive right of the author and inventors to benefit from their works.</p>
